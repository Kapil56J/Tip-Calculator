## What i learned

I learned lot of thigs but apart from this i was incredibly happy to see how much i improved myslef
while making such nice projects after lerning of HTML and CSS with Javascript. This projcts would've beem struggle a while ago.
After plaing around with color combinations and tip calculation, and trying out things on my own, i belive i'm finally comfortable with calculation, and make them responsive as well!
